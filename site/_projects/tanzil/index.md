Tanzil is an Al-Qur'an application for Android platform, built with React Native and packed with features that we think will help user read and memorise Al-Qur'an easily.

When designing & developing this app I learn a lot, starting on how the React Native framework works and how to use it's CSS-like layouting to create beautiful user interface.

The app is available for free without advertisement in it so you can focus more on reading Qur'an without distraction.
